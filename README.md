A robust framework combining the 

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Ethereum Blockchain for secure, tamper-proof image data storage and key management.


# Features

- Secure Encryption: Uses AES-128 for strong symmetric image data encryption.



- Decentralized Key Management: Encryption keys are stored on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure immutability and prevent unauthorized access.



- Tamper-Proof Integrity: Blockchain provides verifiable tracking and authenticity for encrypted images.


- Access Control: Implemented via Solidity smart contracts for automated user authentication and key retrieval.


# Quick Start (Development Environment)

Setup: Utilize Ganache for a local blockchain, Remix IDE for smart contracts, and MetaMask for account management.

Run: Execute the Python script (in VS Code) to encrypt, store key metadata on the blockchain, and decrypt the image.

Bash

# Encrypts, records key, and decrypts
python aes_image_encry_decry.py
