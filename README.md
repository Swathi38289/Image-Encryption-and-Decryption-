#Project Title

Image Encryption and Decryption

---
#Description

Image encryption and decryption is a process used to protect images from being viewed by unauthorized people.

Image Encryption is the process of converting a regular image (like a JPEG or PNG) into a jumbled, unreadable format. It's like putting a photo in a locked box. Only someone with the correct key can open it. This makes the image secure for transmission or storage.

Image Decryption is the reverse process. It uses a specific key or algorithm to convert the encrypted, unreadable image back into its original, viewable format. This allows the intended recipient to see the image as it was originally.

## How to Use
This section explains how to run the code.

Instructions

1)Set up Ganache: Start the Ganache application to create a personal blockchain on your computer. This will give you a list of test accounts and a local network URL.

2)Open Project in VS Code: Use VS Code to open the project folder containing your Solidity code.

3)Deploy with Remix: Open Remix IDE in your web browser.

4)Connect Remix to your local Ganache network by selecting the "Injected Web3" environment in the "Deploy & run transactions" tab.

5)Select your smart contract file and click "Deploy". This will deploy the contract to your Ganache test network.

6)Interact with the Contract: Once the contract is deployed, you can use the functions in the Remix IDE to perform the image encryption and decryption operations.

## Project Files

1)AES 128.py: This file contains the implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with a 128-bit key. It is used to securely encrypt and decrypt the image data.

2)Blockchain code.py: This file includes the core logic for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, such as deploying the smart contract, handling transactions, and managing the image data's secure storage and retrieval on the network.
